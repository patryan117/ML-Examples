# ML Intro
   - a) Simple linear regression on (Boston Housing Dataset)
   - b) Classifier Algorithm Comparison (Titanic Dataset)
   - c) Regression Algorithm Comparison (Extended Boston Housing Dataset) #TODO
   - d) Hand Writtin Digit Recognition (MNIST Dataset) #TODO
   
(Note: algorithms are currently writen in .py files, but will be reformatted as .ipynb format shortly)
